        <p><em><span>Effective date:&nbsp;</span><span>June 15</span><span>, 201</span><span>6</span></em></p>
        <p><span>Welcome to Congo ("Congo," "we," "us" or "our"). Congo provides cloud automated media post-production services. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</span></p>
        <p><span>This Privacy Policy applies to the&nbsp;</span><span>Congo app</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>website,&nbsp;</span><span>any subdomains thereof, any API integrations or widgets we offer, and any other websites or webpages we own or operate that include a link to this policy (all of which together are referred to as the "</span><span>App</span><span>").&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Our Privacy Policy explains how we&nbsp;</span><span>c</span><span>ollect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Congo services (collectively, the "</span><span>Service</span><span>"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</span></p>
        <p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
        <p><span>A. Information you provide us directly:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Your username, password and e-mail&nbsp;</span><span>address when you register for a&nbsp;</span><span>Congo account.</span></li>
            <li><span>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name,&nbsp;</span><span>social media account usernames,&nbsp;</span><span>other</span><span>).&nbsp;</span></li>
            <li><span>User Content (e.g.,&nbsp;</span><span>videos</span><span>) that you post to the Service.</span></li>
            <li><span>Communications between you and Congo. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>B. Analytics information:</span></p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><span>We use&nbsp;</span><span>third-party analytics&nbsp;</span><span>tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p><span>C. Cookies and similar technologies:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Congo and provide features to you.</span></li>
            <li><span>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by&nbsp;</span><span>us or the third party</span><span>.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>D. Traffic Data:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Traffic Data</span><span>&nbsp;is automatically reported by your browser</span><span>&nbsp;each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</span></li>
            <li><span>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our&nbsp;</span><span>Users which then help us</span><span>&nbsp;track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>E. Device identifiers:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Congo.</span></li>
            <li><span>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help&nbsp;</span><span>us or others</span><span>&nbsp;provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>F. Metadata:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</span></li>
            <li><span>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a&nbsp;</span><span>hashtag</span><span>&nbsp;(e.g., to mark keywords when you post a&nbsp;</span><span>video</span><span>),&nbsp;</span><span>geotag</span><span>&nbsp;(e.g., to mark your location to a&nbsp;</span><span>video</span><span>), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you&nbsp;</span><span>geotag</span><span>&nbsp;your&nbsp;</span><span>video</span><span>&nbsp;or tag your&nbsp;</span><span>video</span><span>&nbsp;using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the&nbsp;</span><span>video</span><span>&nbsp;and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your&nbsp;</span><span>video</span><span>&nbsp;is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
        <p><span>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>help</span><span>&nbsp;you efficiently access your information after you sign in</span></li>
            <li><span>remember</span><span>&nbsp;information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;</span></li>
            <li><span>provide</span><span>&nbsp;personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing</span></li>
            <li><span>provide</span><span>, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</span></li>
            <li><span>develop</span><span>&nbsp;and test new products and features</span></li>
            <li><span>monitor</span><span>&nbsp;metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</span></li>
            <li><span>diagnose</span><span>&nbsp;or fix technology problems</span></li>
            <li><span>automatically</span><span>&nbsp;update the Congo application on your device</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
        <p><span>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Congo (or the group of companies of which Congo is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.&nbsp;</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>Parties with whom we may share your information:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Congo is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your&nbsp;</span><span>video</span><span>s.</span></li>
            <li><span>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</span></li>
            <li><span>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</span></li>
            <li><span>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share&nbsp;</span><span>anonymized</span><span>&nbsp;data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public,&nbsp;</span><span>as</span><span>&nbsp;controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</span></li>
            <li><span>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Congo API have copied or saved that information.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>What happens in the event of a change of&nbsp;</span><span>control:</span></p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><span>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Congo or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p><span>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</span></p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><span>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</span></li>
